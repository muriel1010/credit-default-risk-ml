## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Banks and lenders must determine **which applicants are likely to default**.  
Even small improvements in risk modeling can save millions of dollars.

This project demonstrates how ML can:

- Reduce loan default losses  
- Improve lending decisions  
- Support automated underwriting  
- Enable risk-based pricing  

The model predicts:  
- **`Status = 1` → Default**  
- **`Status = 0` → Non-default**

## 📈 Model Performance (Test Set)

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.87** |
| **PR-AUC** | **0.81** |
| **Recall (default class)** | **0.63** |
| **Accuracy** | **0.88** |

Confusion Matrix:

[[16259 546]
[ 2055 3441]]

### Interpretation  
- Strong **ranking ability** between risky vs safe borrowers  
- High **recall** for defaults → essential for risk teams  
- Balanced performance for imbalanced financial data

# 🔍 Key Modeling Decisions

## ✔ 1. Leakage Prevention

To avoid unrealistic accuracy, the following post-underwriting features were removed:

- `Interest_rate_spread`  
- `rate_of_interest`  
- `Upfront_charges`

These contain decisions made *after* risk evaluation → keeping them would artificially inflate performance.

Identifier-like leakage was also checked by identifying columns where unique values perfectly predicted the target.

---

## ✔ 2. Train/Validation/Test Strategy

A rigorous, industry-grade data-splitting strategy:

- **70%** training  
- **15%** validation  
- **15%** test  
- Stratified by target distribution  
- Group-aware splitting when `ID` column existed  
- Threshold tuned on validation set (maximize F1-score)  

---

## ✔ 3. Machine Learning Pipeline

### **Preprocessing (via ColumnTransformer)**  
- Numerical → Median imputation  
- Categorical → Most frequent imputation + OneHotEncoder  

### **Models tested**  
- Logistic Regression (baseline)  
- **XGBoost (selected model)**  

### **Production Export**  
Saved under `model_artifacts/`:

- `credit_risk_model_FINAL.joblib`  
- `schema.json` → feature names, threshold, metadata

This ensures that anyone can run predictions with identical preprocessing and logic.

# 🖥️ Streamlit App (Interactive Scoring)

The deployed app allows users to:

- Input applicant + loan details  
- Adjust income, LTV, DTI, credit score, region, age  
- Generate **default probability** using the trained ML model  
- Display **Low / Medium / High Risk** categories  
- Simulate underwriting decisions  

This mirrors how risk officers interact with real production scoring tools.

# 📊 Business-Friendly Summary

This project demonstrates:

- Credit risk modeling following **best practices used in banking**  
- Clear identification + removal of information leaks  
- Building a fair, robust, transparent model  
- Deploying it in a usable application for analysts or credit officers  

It shows both **technical depth** and **business intuition**.
